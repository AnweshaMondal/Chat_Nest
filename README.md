TextApp - Real-Time Chat Application
Overview
TextApp is a feature-rich, real-time chat application designed to facilitate seamless communication between users. Built using the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this application leverages modern web technologies to provide a responsive and interactive user experience. Additional libraries and tools like Socket.IO and JWT enhance its real-time capabilities and security features.
Used Technologies

MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database that stores user data, chat histories, and other relevant information in a scalable and efficient manner.
Express.js: A robust Node.js framework that serves as the backend, handling API requests, routing, and server-side logic.
React.js: A popular JavaScript library used for building the dynamic and reusable frontend components of the application.
UI Design: Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, is utilized to create a clean, modern, and responsive user interface.
Node.js: The runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side, powering the backend and real-time features.

Other Used Technologies

Socket.IO: A powerful JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the web client (browser) and the server. This is the backbone of the chat functionality, ensuring messages are delivered instantly.
JWT (JSON Web Token): A secure and compact way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object. It is widely used for authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access the chat features.

Features

Real-time messaging with instant delivery.
User authentication and secure login/signup process.
Responsive design compatible with various devices.
Dynamic user list for easy navigation.

💬 ChatNest – Real-Time MERN Chat Application

ChatNest is a full-stack real-time chat application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), designed to deliver secure, fast, and scalable messaging. With Socket.IO for live communication, JWT authentication, and a clean, responsive UI, this project showcases my ability to build production-ready web applications from scratch.

✨ Key Highlights

⚡ Real-Time Messaging – One-to-one messaging powered by Socket.IO with sub-200ms latency.

👥 User Authentication – Secure login & registration with JWT tokens, bcrypt password hashing, and session handling.

🟢 Online/Offline Status – Presence indicators update instantly as users join or leave.

🔔 Notifications – New messages trigger instant updates and conversation list refresh.

🖥️ Responsive UI – Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI, optimized for mobile & desktop.

📂 Scalable Backend – Modular APIs for authentication, user management, and chat storage with MongoDB.

🛠️ Frontend State Management – Used Zustand to manage chat state cleanly and efficiently.

☁️ Deployment Ready – Version control with Git/GitHub and cloud deployment setup on Render.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Real-Time: Socket.IO
Authentication: JWT, Bcrypt, Cookies

🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

Demonstrates end-to-end development of a real-time application.

Implements industry-grade authentication & security practices.

Follows modular backend design for scalability.

Uses modern UI frameworks (Tailwind + DaisyUI) for a professional look.

Covers real-world chat app essentials → presence, notifications, instant messaging.
